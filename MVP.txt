Front end: 
  - Minimal UI, needs mock nav bar, dropzone for file(s)
  - Will display return from server on the page in a list

Back end:
  - Determine DB (As of now I dont see why we can't go Cosmos or Mongo)
  - Set up single endpoint '/api/fileDump' (or whatever)
    - End point will handle Azure service of extracting data from the image
      then storing that data, then sending it back to the client as a JSON obj
 
For POC/MVP I dont feel we need to go crazy with Auth or security, lets just 
see for right now if this is easily configured and how the data is stored & returned
